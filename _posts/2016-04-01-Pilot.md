[A wise man once said,](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/){:target="_blank"}

> I want you to write. Not just code. Also words.

### Motivation

I was looking for reasons to blog, actually for some really good reasons so that I can get up my ass and do something which is (umm..) less procrastinating.

And then I found [this article by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/){:target="_blank"} and here I am writing my first post.

The above article contains some nice compelling points and you should definitely check it out. 

### What and Why of this blog

Although I consider myself as a terrible writer, I am starting this blog, 

* So that I can have place to gather my thoughts and refer to later
* To share what I learn so that others can learn from it
* To engage with the developer community
* And hopefully improve my job prospects

### Conclusion

I am hoping to get out of this procrastinating habit (hell), and actually do something of value. And add valuable posts which can help the community.

See you soon. :)
